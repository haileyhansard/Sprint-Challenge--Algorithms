#NOTES: 
# Robot can:
#  move left
#  move right 
#  pick up item
#  compare item its holding to the item in front of it
#  swap item if it tries to pick up item & is already holding item
#  switch light on or off

#RULES:
# Can use loops, for, while
# Cannot make up new variables
# Cannot store any variables
# Cannot use python libraries or class methods.
# Can define robot helper methods, as long as they follow rules.

# SORT LIST using ONLY these abilites.

# The robot can compare 2 items and swap them, so I could use Selection Sort or Bubble Sort.

# Robot is initialized at position 0, holding NO item, with her light OFF.

# Bubble Sort:
# Starting with current_position which is 0, pick up that value, which is None.
# Move right.
# Compare value of None to the value at position 1.
# If next's value is larger, swap. (because we want largest values at end)

# def bubble_sort(arr):
# keep a flag that tracks whether any swaps occurred 
#   swaps_occurred = True 
#   while swaps_occurred:
#       swaps_occurred = False 
#       for i in range(len(arr)-1):

#               arr[i], arr[i+1] = arr[i+1], arr[i]
